        "   - Dictionaries in yton store data using a structure called a hash table, which allow them to efficiently map keys to values. Here's a breakdown of how it works under the hood:\n",
        "       (1) Each key is hashed:\n",
        "           - when you add a key-value air to a dictionary, Python uses a hash function to turn the key into a unique number (called a hash).\n",
        "           - Example: 'name' > hash('name') > some integer like 3456789.\n",
        "       (2) The hash determines where the value is stored:\n",
        "           - the hash is used to compute an index in an internal array (bucket array)\n",
        "           - Python stores the value at that index, along with the key (to handle collision).\n",
        "       (3) Collisions are handled:\n",
        "           - Two keys might hash to the same index\n",
        "           - Python handles this using open addressing (probing nearby slots)or chaining (a list of key-value pairs at the same index).\n",
        "       (4) Retrieving Data:\n",
        "           - To retrieve a value:\n",
        "                - python hashes the key,\n",
        "                - finds the correct index,\n",
        "                - and then compares the key to confirm it matches before returning the value.\n",
        "        (5) Keys must be hashable\n",

        "     - Sets are implemented using hash tables, which allows for very fast membership testing (checking if an element is in the sets). This makes sets more efficient than lists for large collection where you need to perform frequent membership check.\n",
        "     - Sets support various mathematical set operations, such as union, inersection, and difference. These Operations can be useful for tasks like finding the common elements between two collections or identifying the elements that are unique to one collection.\n",

This characterstics prevets accidental or unauthorized changes to the data, ensuring its consistency and reliability throughout the program's execution. Immutability also allows tuples to be used as keys in dictionaries and elements in sets, as their hash values remain constant.\n",

        "    - in older versions of python (before 3.7), dictionaries did not guarantee the order of items. this means:\n",
        "       - the order in which you inserted key-value pairs could be different form the order you got them back.\n",
        "       - the underlying hash table focused on performance and fast lookups, not order.\n",
        "    - what changed in python 3.7+?\n",
        "        - starting with python 3.7, dictionaries preserve insertion orde as an official lanuage feature. that means, if you insert items in aa specific order, iterating over the dictionary will return them in that same order.\n",
        "## How it affects data retrieval:\n",
        "    - Pre3.7 (unordered):\n",
        "         - you couldn't rely on the order for display, iteration, or comparisons.\n",
        "         - use cases requiring order used collections.ordereddict.\n",
        "    - 3.7+ (ordered):\n",
        "         - you can rely on insertion order during iteration.\n",
        "         - still when you access by key (like my_dict[\"nane\"]), order doesn't matter- you are directly jumping to the value using the key (0(1)lookup)."
